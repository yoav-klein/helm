# Partial templates
---

This is where things get really weird. 

In this example, we demonstrate how to include a named (or partial) template
in a template, handling all the whitespaces and newlines.

In this example, we use the `template` action, which is not what we'll usually use.
Rather, `include` is a better choice, as we'll see.
